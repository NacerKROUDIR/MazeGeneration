## Description
This GitHub repository hosts the code for maze generation and maze solution finding algorithms. The project focuses on creating captivating mazes and providing efficient algorithms to navigate through them.<br>
This repository will be updated frequently to add different algorithms and other interesting features. Each time an algorithm is added, a brief description will be added in the section below<br>

## Maze Generation Algorithms
### Randomized Depth-First-Search algorithm
The Randomized Depth-First Search (DFS) maze generation algorithm is a technique that creates perfect square mazes with a single solution path. It uses a modified DFS approach with randomization. Starting from a specific cell, it randomly chooses unvisited neighboring cells to explore. The algorithm backtracks when it reaches a dead end, ensuring the maze has no loops. It also keeps track of the solution path from the top left cell to the bottom right cell. This algorithm generates visually appealing and solvable mazes for maze-solving and navigation.<br>
